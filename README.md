# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis of kickstarter campaigns is designed for Louise to determine the best way to crowdfund her play with a budget of $10,000. We will compare thousands of campaigns to help Louise design a campaign that will succeed.

Initially we discovered that crowdfunding campaigns for theater were generally successful.  Out of 912 total campaigns, 525 were successful (58%) as shown in the following graph.

Similiarly, Kickstarter campaigns for plays have a high rate of success with 238 of 314 being successful (76%) as shown in this graph. It also appears that May is the best time for having a successful campaign.

As for Louise's interest in producing a future musical in Great Britian, she should try one that can be produced for less than 4,000.
