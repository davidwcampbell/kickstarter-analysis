# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis of kickstarter campaigns is designed for Louise to determine the best way to crowdfund her play with a budget of $10,000. We will compare thousands of campaigns to help Louise design a campaign that will succeed.

Initially we discovered that crowdfunding campaigns for theater were generally successful.  Out of 912 total campaigns, 525 were successful (58%) as shown in the following graph.

Similiarly, Kickstarter campaigns for plays have a high rate of success with 238 of 314 being successful (76%). 

It also appears that May is the best time for having a successful campaign.

As for Louise's interest in producing a future musical in Great Britian, she should try one that can be produced for less than 4,000. In an analysis of 5 plays produced in Edinburgh, we discovered that 4,137 was the largest pledged amount.
 

### Challenge
Continuing this analysis for Louise, we wanted to see how many other Kickstarter campaigns did well and to determine if length of campaign affected the success or failure.  We completed two analyses, one looking at the outcomes based on goal and the other examining outcomes based on launch date.

The Outcomes Based on Goal showed that campaigns with goals less than $5,000 were the most successful.  Campaigns with goals from $5,000 to $45,000 performed well with a 40-50% success rate and campaigns $45,000 and greater did not perform as well (<30% success rate). The following graph illustrates these results.

The second analysis we completed in this challenge was Outcomes Based on Launch Date.  This graph shows that theater Kickstarter campaigns are generally successful (60% success rate).  It also indicates that campaigns starting in May, June, and July are the most successful.

As a summary, we learned that:
* Kickstarter campaigns with goals less than $5,000 perform best.
* Kickstarter campaigns with goals greater than $45,000 perform poorly.
* Theater Kickstarter campaigns are generally successful (60%).
* May, June, and July are the best months to have a Kickstarter campaign.

One question that we did not answer was what impact does the length of campaign have on success. We could easily calculate and present this additional analysis from the data we have. Some limitations to our data include; details on how the campaign was executed (online, in-person, etc.), demographic data on the people donating (income, age, etc.), and additional details on location of the donor (urban, rural, etc.).
