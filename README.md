# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis of kickstarter campaigns is designed for Louise to determine the best way to crowdfund her play with a budget of $10,000. We will compare thousands of campaigns to help Louise design a campaign that will succeed.

Initially we discovered that crowdfunding campaigns for theater were generally successful.  Out of 912 total campaigns, 525 were successful (58%) as shown in the following graph.

Similiarly, Kickstarter campaigns for plays have a high rate of success with 238 of 314 being successful (76%) as shown in this graph. It also appears that May is the best time for having a successful campaign.

As for Louise's interest in producing a future musical in Great Britian, she should try one that can be produced for less than 4,000.
 

### Challenge
Continuing this analysis for Louise, we wanted to see how many other Kickstarter campaigns did well and to determine if length of campaign affected the success or failure.  We completed two analyses, one looking at the outcomes based on goal and the other examining outcomes based on launch date.

The Outcomes Based on Goal showed that campaigns with goals less than $5,000 were the most successful.  Campaigns with goals from $5,000 to $45,000 performed well with a 40-50% success rate and campaigns $45,000 and greater did not perform as well (<30% success rate).
